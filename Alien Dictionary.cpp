1- first of all we have to create a graph.
the vertcices of the graph will be the first characters of the adjacent words
of the dictionary such that the first characters we picked are different.
This is done because the dictionary given to us is sorted hence meaning the worwd which comes
eariler is eariler because of that first character which is different from the next adjacent 
word in the dictionary. Therefore that first character is BASIS of sorting of the words.

2- Once the graph is been created then we will do the Topological Sorting
